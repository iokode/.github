## Content Type

The content will be mainly about software development, ranging from purely technical posts, to my own reflections and personal opinions, to documenting challenges I have encountered and how I approached solving them.

There is content for all levels, from articles on how something works at a low level, to information that can even be consumed by people outside the industry. So if your knowledge is not very advanced, not all of the content may be for you, but you will still be able to read a large part of it.

## Open Source Projects

In addition to blog posts, IOKode develops several Open Source projects. These projects can range from libraries and frameworks such as the [OpinionatedFramework](https://github.com/iokode/OpinionatedFramework) project to complete applications.

## Collaborating

Iâ€™m opening the blog to collaborators in multiple ways:

- **Write**: Guest authors are welcome to publish here. Free speech is constitutionally guaranteed. Posts can be tutorials, opinions, deep dives, commentary on industry trends, or anything else youâ€™d like to share.
- **Fix**: Posts are now plain Markdown files in a GitHub repository, so anyone can submit pull requests to correct typos, improve clarity, or add information.
- **Donate**: If youâ€™d like to help sustain the project, you can contribute through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/iokode).
- **Comment**: Every post has a comments section. Whether you want to give feedback, ask questions, or share your experience, leaving a comment is a great way to contribute.
- **Share**: Not ready to write or donate? No problem. You can still help a lot by simply sharing posts you find useful. Repost them on X, LinkedIn, Reddit, or just send them to a friend.

If youâ€™d like to publish a post, please make sure to read Section 2 of the [Constitution](https://iokode.blog/constitution).
